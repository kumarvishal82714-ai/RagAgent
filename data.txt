RAG means Retrieval Augmented Generation.
It helps AI answer from custom data.
RAG is used in chatbots.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR CODE SOLVING:
When solving a coding problem:
1. First explain the approach
2. Then explain time and space complexity
3. Then provide code in C++ and Python
4. Use simple language

TOPIC: Programming Basics
=====================================

Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform tasks.
Popular programming languages include C, C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript.

-------------------------------------
TOPIC: Array
-------------------------------------
An array is a data structure that stores multiple values of the same data type in a single variable.
Each element in an array is stored at a contiguous memory location.
Arrays are used to store lists of data such as numbers, marks, or names.

Example of array in C:
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

Advantages of array:
- Fast access using index
- Easy to store multiple values

Disadvantages of array:
- Fixed size
- Insertion and deletion are difficult

-------------------------------------
TOPIC: Linked List
-------------------------------------
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes.
Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store data in contiguous memory.

Types of linked lists:
- Singly linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Circular linked list

-------------------------------------
TOPIC: Stack
-------------------------------------
Stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO principle (Last In First Out).
Main operations of stack are push, pop, and peek.
Stacks are used in function calls, undo-redo operations, and expression evaluation.

-------------------------------------
TOPIC: Queue
-------------------------------------
Queue is a linear data structure that follows FIFO principle (First In First Out).
Operations in queue are enqueue and dequeue.
Queues are used in scheduling and buffering.

-------------------------------------
TOPIC: Python Programming
-------------------------------------
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
It is known for its simple syntax and readability.
Python is widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, and automation.

Example:
print("Hello World")

-------------------------------------
TOPIC: Artificial Intelligence
-------------------------------------
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
AI enables machines to learn, reason, and make decisions.
Examples of AI include chatbots, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars.

-------------------------------------
TOPIC: Machine Learning
-------------------------------------
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.
It allows machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
Types of machine learning:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

-------------------------------------
TOPIC: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
-------------------------------------
RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.
It combines information retrieval with language generation.
RAG helps AI systems answer questions using custom data sources.

RAG is commonly used in:
- Chatbots
- Question answering systems
- Knowledge assistants
